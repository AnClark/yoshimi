When running from the command line all the following can now be entered after the 'up and running' message.

setup - displays the current dynamic system settings.

show paths - display all the currently defined bank root paths and their IDs.

list root (n) - lists all the banks and their IDs in root path 'n' (or the current root).

list bank (n) - lists all the instruments and their IDs in bank 'n' (or the current bank) of the current root.

set rootcc [n] - set the MIDI CC for root path changes (128 disables).

set bankcc [n] - set the MIDI CC for bank changes (anything other than 0 or 32 disables).

set path [n] - set current root path to ID 'n'.

set bank [n] - set current bank to ID 'n'.

set part [n1] program [n2] - load instrument 'n2' into par 'n1'.


Commands are not case sensitive and an invalid one will print a reminder. usually, you only need the first 4 letters of the names provided that is unabiguous. i.e. 'rootcc' has to be in full so it isn't confused with 'root'.

More will be added, and the organisation of them may be changed slightly.
