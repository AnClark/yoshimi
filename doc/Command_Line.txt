Commands are not case sensitive and an invalid one will print a reminder. usually, you only need the first 4 letters of the names - as long as it is unabiguous. i.e. 'rootcc' has to be in full so it isn't confused with 'root'.

Commands with '*' in the description need the setup to be saved, and Yoshimi restarted to be activated. 

More will be added, and the organisation of them may be changed slightly.
