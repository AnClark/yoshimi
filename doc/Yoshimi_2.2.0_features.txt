Version 2.2.0

A major feature is the revision of the PadSynth engine incuding the following:
A new mode control in 'Settings' gives 'Muted', 'Background' and 'Auto-Apply'
'Muted' is the old form where the part is disabled while the wavetable is being built.
'Background' (the new default) allows you to continue using the exisiting wavetable until the new one is built, then makes it available to apply - this will then be done seamlessly.
'Auto-Apply' as the name suggests will seamlessly apply the wavetable once it is ready.

In the Padsynth engine itself there is a new control allowing you to set how long it takes to fade to the new wavetable.

Also, there is a New experimental 'Retrigger' window with various morphing controls.

In the main window there are Undo/Redo buttons for comprehensive Undo/Redo operations.

A new control allows you to set an internal Midi Clock over a wide range if Yoshimi can't see an incoming one - useful for synced LFOs.

Not forgetting, the usual bugfixes and minor detail enhancements.

Yoshimi source code is available from either:
