This now quite fully (but not completely) implemented.

To learn, hold CTRL while right-clicking on any GUI control. You will get a message if the control is not learnable.

After that, the first physical controller you move, or CC message you send will be locked, and you'll see the GUI knob or slider move in sympathy with the physical control.

If you now use the 'Yoshimi' drop-down menu and click on 'Midi Learn' you will see a new window displaying your recently learned controller. Along with a number of settings, you'll see text with precise details of this complete action.

Editor settings available:

Incoming CC.

Incoming channel number.

Minimum & Maximum incoming values (if Min is greater than Max it reverses the control direction).

The range can either be in the style of a limiter or as compression.

Blocking of all later actions on the same CC/channel pair (including system ones).

Muting of this action.

You can delete any existing line by holding down the 'CTRL' key and then clicking on the 'Control Function' text for that line. You will then be presented with a confirmation message giving the line number and the text as a reminder.

The same CC/controller can be used to change several different internal Yoshimi controls. e.g. you can have a part's volume being changed while another part is having an effect level changed.

Adding or deleting lines, or changing either CC or channel numbers will re-order the others.

You can also clear the entire learned list.

A complete list can be saved by clicking on the 'save' button and you will get the usual filer window.

Loading sets follows the same practice. If a loaded set refers to Yoshimi controls at are disabled, or don't exist such controls will be ignored, but the 'block feature will still be active.

Finaly, there is a button for loading a set from the recent history.

To come:
Paging of the display so you don't end up scrolling through a massive list.
