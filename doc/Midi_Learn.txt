This now quite fully (but not completely) implemented.

To learn, hold CTRL while right-clicking on any GUI control. You will get a message if the control is not learnable.

After that, the first physical controller you move, or CC message you send will be locked, and you'll see the GUI knob or slider move in sympathy with the physical control.

If you now use the 'Yoshimi' drop-down menu and click on 'Midi Learn' you will see a new window displaying your recently learned controller. Along with a number of settings, you'll see text with precise details of this complete action.

Editor settings available:

Incoming CC.

Incoming channel number.

Minimum & Maximum incoming values (if Min is greater than Max it reverses the control direction).

The range can either be in the style of a limiter or as compression.

Blocking of all later actions on the same CC/channel pair (including system ones).

Muting of this action.

You can delete any exisiting line by holding down the 'CTRL' key and tyhen clcking on the 'Control Function' text for that line. You will then be presented with a confirmation message giving the line number and the text as a reminder.

Adding or deleting lines, or changing either CC or channel numbers will re-order the others.

To come:
Saving and loading.
Paging of the display so you don't end up scrolling through a massive list.
