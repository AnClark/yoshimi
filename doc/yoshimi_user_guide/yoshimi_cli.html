    <p>
    Yoshimi supplies a command line interface (CLI) that can perform any action that is available in the graphical interface (GUI). The CLI closely follows the GUi with respect to context levels.
    However, some control names are changed to enable shorter abbreviations the be used.
    </p>
    <p>
    With Yoshimi installed, open a terminal window and type 'yoshimi' to start. Unless you have disabled the GUI it will also show, but the prompt you will see will be something like the following:
    <div class = "code">
Yoshimi 2.1.0 is starting
Using jack_audio for audio and alsa_midi for midi
Alsa midi priority is 39
Yoshimi 2.1.0 M
Build Number 2008
Clientname: yoshimi
Audio: jack -&gt 'default'
Midi: alsa -&gt 'Hua Xing:0, Komplete Audio 6:0'
Oscilsize: 512
Samplerate: 48000
Period size: 64

Yay! We're up and running :-)

Found 7284 instruments in 201 banks
Root 9. Bank set to 115 "The_Mysterious_Bank"
GUI refreshed
yoshimi>
    </div>
    A minor annoyance is that the GUI will take input focus, so you will have to click in the terminal window again to make further commands.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are a number of commands that can be set at the time you start Yoshimi, and before starting you can view these with:
    <div class = "code">
music@devuan:~$ yoshimi --help
    </div>
    This doesn't actually start Yoshimi itself, but as you can see there are a lot of options available, and many of these can be stacked when you do start, such as:
    <div class = "code">
    yoshimi -b=128 -i -j
    </div>
    In this example we are setting the buffer size to 128 frames, disabling the GUI and setting MIDI input to Jack.<br>The full list of options is:
    <div class = "code">

    Once running in the CLI you will be at the top level and entering just a '?' will list all the available commands and also the names of the available contexts. If reporting is set for the CLI this will be paged as shown below.
    <div class = "code">
yoshimi&gt ?
Commands:

    Quitting this pager will return you to the prompt. Notice it now shows the current context level.
    <div class = "code">
@ Top
yoshimi&gt
    </div>
     When entering the query on other context levels you will normally get the first few top level ones as a reminder these are available from <em>any</em> level. Other than that you will only see the commands (and deeper contexts) appropriate to that level. However, you can also specifically query a context from <em>any</em> point , in which case you will see the list for that one only, without changing your current position.
    <div class = "code">
@ p1+, Sub
yoshimi&gt ? vector
Vector:
  &ltn&gt                         set current base channel

@ p1+, Sub

    </div>
    Many context levels have defaults that kick in if you don't add additional information. The most obvious being the <em>Part</em> level with just:
    <div class = "code">
yoshimi&gt set part
@ Part 1+
yoshimi&gt
    </div>
    You not only see that it is on part 1 but the '+' indicates it's enabled. There are lots of hints like this. Also any context with numeric settings can be changed simply with the number:
    <div class = "code">
yoshimi&gt set 5
@ Part 5
yoshimi&gt
    </div>
    Note part 5 has not yet been enabled.
    <br><br>
    Many actions will stack if the respective context levels are active:
    <div class = "code">
@ Part 5
yoshimi&gt s 1 add voice wave
@ p1+, A+, V1+ Sine
yoshimi&gt
    </div>
    Here we used the minimum abbreviation for 'set'. You will also see that not only have we jumped right up into the waveform context of Addsynth Voice 1, but that the current waveform is 'Sine' and all the earlier labels are now compressed to the minimum so that the line doesn't get ridiculously long.
