    SubSynth is the simplest engine from the point view of the number of controls. It is a single view of (in essence) a broadband noise generator with a series of <em>harmonics</em> filters that only allow comparatively narrow bands through to the output. There are also the following standardised inserts. Most of these are initially disabled.

    Very obvious is the scrollable row of sliders. These represent 64 harmonic bands, the upper row being the amplitude, and the lower row the bandwidth. At minimum bandwith the harmonics are close to sinewaves, and at maximum they are very obviously noise.
    <br><br>
    The <b>Bandwidth</b> control (top centre) sets the overall range and the <b>Bandwidth Scale</b> changes the frequency scaling of this range that is applied. so you can have quite narrow LF bands with wide HF ones, or vice-versa.
