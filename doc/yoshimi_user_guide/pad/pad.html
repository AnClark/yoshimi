    The PadSynth engine has two tabbed views in a single window. You will normally be shown the harmonic structure, the envelopes one (as it's name suggests) consisting mostly of envelope and LFO inserts.
    </p>

    <h3>Harmonic Structure</h3>

    There is a button to give access to an overall <a href="../resonance/resonance.html">Resonance</a> that can be applied to the engine.

    Below this is a <a href="../wave/wave.html">Waveform</a> button which gives access to a highly detailed waveshape editor.

    If any of these controls are alterered it will be necessary to click on the <em>Apply</em> button as the wavetable has to be rebuilt.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>Envelopes and LFOs</h3>
    <div class="tab">
    Once again we have all the standard inserts. There are also the local controls found in AddSynth and SubSynth. None of these affect the wavetable itself, so there is no need for the apply button here.
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
    The <b>Export</b> button that appears at the bottom of both of these views takes you to a filer window for exporting a complete wavetable with the total number of samples you have currently set. These don't include any changes in the sound produced by controls in the envelopes window.
