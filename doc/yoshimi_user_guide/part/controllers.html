    The controls affect the way incoming MIDI Continuous Controllers (CCs) behave, both their range of control and in some cases, the type of control.

    <b>Reset all controllers</b> As its name suggests, this simply returns all the above controls to their default values.

    These are five of the most commonly used CCs sent by external systems. This window not only tracks their current postions (so you can see when they are being changed) but you can also directly set the values from here. Additionally the controls can be MIDI-learned. As an example a foot pedal can be diverted to change the filter cutoff setting instead, or even as well as changing volume.
