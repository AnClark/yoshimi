yoshimi-0.060.7-0

Still basically just 0.058.1 plus Paul's unison amd reverb enhancements, and
jack session support.

The 0.060.X series have been plagued by a strange issue affecting some but not
all 32 bit builds. On a few 32 bit systems, ADnotes are incorrectly pitched.
Attempts to resolve this have been going on since last December. For me, this
one works just fine on AV Linux 4.2.
