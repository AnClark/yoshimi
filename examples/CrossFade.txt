CrossFade.xiz is an instrument incorporating the new crossfade feature in kits.

As well as appearing to blend three different sounds, the middle and upper ones have independent effcts, and the lower and upper ones are panned slightly left and right.

If you open the virtual keyboard and use the mouse to run up and down the keys you get a very good idea of how the sound morphs.
