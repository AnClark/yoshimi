yoshimi-0.060.7-1

Still basically just 0.058.1 plus Paul's unison amd reverb enhancements, and
jack session support.


The 0.060.X series have been plagued by a strange issue affecting some but not
all 32 bit builds. On some 32 bit systems, ADnotes were incorrectly pitched.
Lars Luthman has identified the problem and the fix. 0.060.7-1 includes just
that fix, so with some further testing, maybe we can all move on :-).

All hail Lars Luthman!
