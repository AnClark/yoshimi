more granular testing of floating point ops through ADnote

yoshimi-0.060.6-pre2

No significant changes (I can remember), but added tests and stderr logging at

A baseline for testing on the Adnote pitching error.
- some debug logging through ADnote.cpp to monitor freqencies in play.
- testing for math exceptions through Microtonal.cpp base frequency calculations.
