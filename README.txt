V 1.5.10 Redwing

Command Line access is now virtually complete.

The graphic interface has had a minor makeover.
Very occasional corruption of this now resolved.

All inactive controls are now shown as such -
there were a number that previously weren't, thus
causing considerable confusion for new users.

There is an improved pseudo-random number system,
which does not rely on external libraries anymore.
