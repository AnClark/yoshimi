Tunings and keyboard maps are both handled as strings of numbers. Currently, there must be exactly one space between all values.

For scales, where ratios are used there must be no spaces either side of the divisor sign.

In keyboard maps, non-sounding notes should be marked with an 'x' instead of the number.

The scale/keymap sizes are generated internally by counting the number of entries in the strings.

e.g.

Scale:
76.04900 193.15686 310.26471 5/4 503.42157 579.47057 696.57843 25/16 889.73529 1006.84314 1082.89214 2/1

Keyboard Map:
0 1 2 3 x 5 6 7 x 9 10 11
