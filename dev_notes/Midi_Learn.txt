The learn process comes after NRPNs and vectors, but before all other controllers.

To learn, hold CTRL while right-clicking on any GUI control then operate physical control.

Along with parameters, a text string is provided with precise details of this complete action.

Control capabilites:

Incoming CC and channel tracked (in that order).

Multiple actions on the same CC/channel pair.

Range limiting or compression.

Blocking of all later actions on the same CC.channel pair.

Muting of this action.

Status bits:
0   block
1   limit (otherwise compress)
2   mute


When sending internal control messages to the GUI (instead of passing on midi actions) the part number will be 216 - a value that is never used in the rest of the system, but is in the same region as Vectors (and yet to come Scales) and other 'accessory' parts.

This will be used for updating the list and and filling in/altering line entries. The gui will never do these directly, but will request them using the same part number.

Name strings are passed across using the simple message system. These are not editable in the GUI.

These transfers are done outside the RT threads.

Normally the data will be sent as a complete instruction for one line.


data structure:
value       line number (used as an integer)
type        status - this is unique to midilearn
control     normal use
part        216
kit         CC
engine      channel
insert      min_in
parameter   max_in
par2        text message number

The gui will be restricted to 'viewing groups' of 128 lines, it solves a *lot* of problems!


Possible control numbers:
These redraw a line in place.
0   set status (mute, limit, block)
1   set min_in
2   set max-in

These move a line, so a complete redraw is intitalsed.
 8  delete line
16  write line
17  set CC
18  set channel

20  send list size
