The learn process comes after NRPNs and vectors, but before all other controllers.

To learn, hold CTRL while right-clicking on any GUI control then operate physical control.

Along with parameters, a text string will be provided with precise details of this complete action.

Editing will be available eventually. Also the GUI will flicker the colour of the respective control line's number when it sees incomming control messages. It will be black when muted and flash between white and green when active.

Control capabilites:

Incoming CC and channel tracked (in that order).

Multiple actions on the same CC/channel pair.

Range limiting or compression. (not yet).

Blocking of all later actions on the same CC.channel pair (not yet).

Muting of this action (not yet).

Status bits:
0   block
1   compress (otherwise limit)
2   mute


When sending internal control messages to the GUI instead of passing on midi actions, the part number will be 255 - a value that is never used in the rest of the system.

This will be used for updating the list and and fillng in/altering line entries. The gui will never do these directly, but will request them using the same part number.

Name strings will be passed across using the simple message system. These will NOT be editable in the GUI.

These transfers will be done outside the RT threads.
