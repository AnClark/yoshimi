This is a means of exposing various controls to NRPNs.

Many of the commands produce log output in a manner designed to be compatible with both the GUI reports window and with a CLI readline environment.

There are two integer parameters passed in:
type    obvious!
value   the purpose (if any) dependent on the actual function called.

Type:
   2    value = master key shift

   7    value = master volume

64-79   type = channel number (+ 64) value = keyshift

 80     value = root CC

 81     value = bank CC

 82     value > 63 = enable program change

 83     value > 63 = enable part on program change

 84     value = extended program change CC > 119 disables

 85     value = number of parts to be made available (16, 32, 64)

 86     save current settings
