This started out as a means of exposing various controls to NRPNs but proved to be so useful it became considerably expanded and shared by all sorts of inputs.

Many of the commands produce log output in a manner designed to be compatible with both the GUI reports window and with a CLI readline environment.

There are two integer parameters passed in:
type    obvious!
value   the purpose (if any) dependent on the actual function called.

Type:
   2    value = master key shift

   7    value = master volume

64-79   type = channel number (+ 64) value = keyshift

 81     value = root ID to be set as 'current'

 82     value = bank ID to be set as 'current' (in current root)

 83     value = number for program change

 84     value > 63 = enable program change

 85     value > 63 = enable extended program change

 86     value = number of parts to be made available (16, 32, 64)

 87     save current settings
