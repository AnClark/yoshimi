This is intended for direct transfers of text between non-RT threads. Although sychronised and using miscMsg, these do not enter the Command functions at all.

To identify such transfers Parameter is set to 0xf0 (240). Nowhere else does this value appear. Once recognised it is passed to a separate function that does all the decoding.

It is used mostly for setting names, but also for scales and keyboard mappings, which are string representations of number lists.
