Yoshi can now directly set some part values regardless of what channel that part is set to

Using NRPNs

set NRPN
 MSB = 64 {same as for vectors}
 LSB = 0
 
then

DATA MSB (6)
    0 : LSB = Part number
    1 : LSB = program number
    2 { LSB will be controller number }
    3 { LSB will be controller value }
    
    more!
