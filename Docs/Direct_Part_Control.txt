Yoshi can now directly set some part values regardless of what channel that part is set to

Using NRPNs

set NRPN
 MSB = 64 {same as for vectors}
 LSB = 0
 
then

DATA MSB (6)
    0 : LSB = Part number
    1 : LSB = program number
    2 : LSB = controller number
    3 : LSB = controller value
    4 : LSB = part's channel number
    
Other values currently ignored, but more error checking needed.
