LV2 plugin adds one more dependency:
    lv2-dev with minimum version >= 1.2.0. If you are using debian wheezy,
    which has only 1.0.0 version, there is an option to install jessie or sid
    binary package. Here is the list:
    https://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=sourcenames&keywords=lv2
    There is lv2 1.10.0 version at the time of writing which will be just enough.
    These versions are installed smoothly on wheezy.

Other distros may have slightly different names or versions,
and may even have these installed be default.
